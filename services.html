      <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Feature engineering is at the core of our data science workflow, enabling us to transform raw data into meaningful representations that maximize model performance.
        Our team excels at identifying, creating, and refining features through advanced techniques such as feature extraction, selection, scaling, 
        encoding, dimensionality reduction, and interaction term generation. We leverage domain knowledge and statistical insights to 
        engineer features that enhance model accuracy and generalization. Whether working with structured tabular data, time series, 
        or unstructured formats like text and images, our approach to feature engineering ensures your machine learning models are both powerful 
        and interpretable.
